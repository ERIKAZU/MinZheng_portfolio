Project 4 - Design & Plan

Your Team Name: Blue Tigers
Milestone 1, Part II: Client Selection

Client Description

[Tell us about your client. Who is your client? What kind of website do they want? What are their key goals?]
[NOTE: If you are redesigning an existing website, give us the current URL and some screenshots of the current site. Tell us how you plan to update the site in a significant way that meets the final project requirements.]

Existing website: http://www.pietrzakpfau.com/

PIETRZAK & PFAU
Pietrzak & Pfau is an engineering and surveying firm based in Goshen and Monticello New York. They are a one stop shop for project management, handling everything from topographic mapping a piece of land and developing a plan in compliance with local zoning all the way to managing contractors and seeing a project to completion.

They want a website which will attract potential future clients. Essentially, they want to showcase past work and explain the types of services they offer.

Milestone 1, Part III: Client Requirements

Target Audience(s)

[Tell us about the potential audience for this website. How, when, and where would they interact with the website? Get as much detail as possible from the client to help you find representative users.]

The potential audience for this website are prospective clients of Pietrzak & Pfau. This includes both private sector investors as well as the federal government and local municipalities. That being said, Pietrzak & Pfau hopes to attract primarily high end investors in the private sector, because the scale of these projects and type of cliente is desirable to Pietrzak & Pfau. In the past, Pietrzak & Pfau has relied exclusively on word of mouth to generate sales. In fact, Mr. Pietrzak estimated that he has retained 90% percent of his current clients for over 10 years. Accordingly, we will target the highly sought after high end private sector investors with our website.

Purpose & Content

[Tell us the purpose of the website and what it is all about.]

The new website which will attract potential future clients. It will have a section for each of the following steps in the development process that Pietrzak & Pfau engages in.
* Topographic mapping
* Develop a plan to meet zoning
* Deal with government agencies such as NYS DEC and Army Core of Engineers to acquire permits
* Once approved and properly permitted, get bids from contractors and oversee construction according to the plan that their engineers created

Also while they do not do the following in house, they can serve as a liaison between their clients and archeologists, endangered species tracking agencies etc. Pietrzak & Pfau can also work with other engineering firms. In addition, they want to highlight that they use top of the line equipment including Autocad and Surveying robots.

[Collect your client's and target audience's needs and wants for the website. Come up with several appropriate design ideas on how those needs may be met. In the **Memo** field, justify your ideas and add any additional comments you have. There is no specific number of needs required for this, but you need enough to do the job.]

* Needs/Wants
  * #1
  * **Needs and Wants** (What does your client and audience need and want?)
    * Client wants to showcase past work to potential future clients
  * **Design Ideas and Choices** (How will you meet those needs and wants?)
    * Allow website users to search by project type or stage.
  * **Memo** (Justify your decisions; additional notes.)
    * We know that we can execute these ideas from past projects.
    * We want think that being able to sort the past project content will be a useful too for prospective clients.

  * #2
  * **Needs and Wants** (What does your client and audience need and want?)
    * Client wants appointment functionality in the site
  * **Design Ideas and Choices** (How will you meet those needs and wants?)
    * Allow website users and Pietrzak & Pfau employees to make appointments using a login system along with a database to support it.
  * **Memo** (Justify your decisions; additional notes.)
    * We know that we can execute a login system from P3 and the appointments with be relatively easy using content we've learned

### Hosting Plan

[What is your plan for hosting your client's website?]
They have an IT department that can handle the deployment of the website - we just need to ship the source code.

### Client's Edits

[Does the client need the ability to edit the site after the end of the semester? If **Yes**, tell us how you site fit your client's need. If **No**, write down N/A.]

N/A

### Information Architecture, Content, and Navigation

[Lay out the plan for how you'll organize the site and which content will go where. Note any content (e.g., text, image) that you need to make/get from the client.]

[Note: As with the Needs and Wants table, there is no specific amount to write here. You simply need enough content to do the job.]

    * *Engineering*: list all construction projects in the past, together with location and date.

### Interactivity

[What interactive features will your site have? What PHP elements will you include?]

[Much of this is up to you, however, implementing a login system is **required**. Logging in should not be required to view the site, however it must unlock extra functionality, e.g., admin functionality, comment posting, etc.]

[Also, describe how the interactivity connects with the needs of the clients/target audience.]

*  login system. Registered users can login the system to make/cancel appointments with an employee of Pietrzak & Pfau. Also, employees of Pietrzak & Pfau can login the system to check in the clients for appointments. In addition, administrators are able to manage users’ accounts such as deleting an account. This functionality will make the communications between Pietrzak & Pfau and its clients easier, and make the management of clients’ accounts more convenient. Login system requires the use of cookies.

*  Search past projects based on location, year, and/or the services Pietrzak & Pfau provided. This search function enables a new client to learn similar projects Pietrzak & Pfau has accomplished in the past that possess some certained desired characteristics such as the locations and the technology involved.

*  Clickable auto scrolling lists of service available. On the home page, users can click on an item of the auto scrolling lists to view the details of that chosen service, so potential clients are able to view all services at once and learn the corresponding details faster.

*  Appointment system. Registered users can view all available dates for an appointment with Pietrzak & Pfau and make/cancel an appointment.


### External Code

[What libraries (e.g. editor.js, jQuery Cookie, Image Sliders, jQuery) are you planning to use for the site? What do you have to do to incorporate those libraries? How much of your own code will satisfy the project requirements?]

We will most likely use a bit of jQuery for the site to improve interactive styling. As a group we want to learn more on how to implement jQuery so we think it will be a good opportunity to learn with experience.

We will have to use additional resources online to incorporate the libraries. Our own code will mainly satisfy our requirements.

### Scale

[How large will the site be (approximate number of pages) and how many hours of work will be required to complete it?]

The site will include approximately 5 pages. They are served to display the Home page, the surveying techniques employed by Pietrzak & Pfau, the engineering practiced, user login, and the past projects achieved. Approximately 90 hours of work will be required. We think we will work on it for about 6 hours per week per person.

## Milestone 1, Part IV: Work Distribution

[Describe how each of your responsibilities will be distributed among your group members.]

[Set internal deadlines. Determine your internal dependencies. Whose task needs to be completed first in order for another person's task to be relevant? Be specific in your task descriptions so that everyone knows what needs to be done and can track the progress effectively. Consider how much time will be needed to review and integrate each other's work. Most of all, make sure that tasks are balanced across the team.]

Deadlines:

4/24/18 - Everyones's wire frames and schema's are due

5/1/18 - Everyones's code is due

5/3/18 - User testing - have our friends test the site

5/5/18 - Client testing - update from user testing and have our client test the site

5/8/18 - Make changes as based on client requests and finalize our design.


Tasks:
We decided to split the tasks by pages for now. We will continuously be collaborating across pages, we just want to split up the work like this for the beginning so we can
Beginning tasks to consider:
Make skeleton for all pages
Create consistent div names for content for future styling
Create database

Larger pages:
Services: Cari
Engineering: Yuzhe and Min
Surveying: Shoshana
Portfolio: Baxter
Individual images page
Link work to other pages?
We will have approximately 6 pages. One page for each of the main content and at least one additional for the database on the portfolio that allows you to get a closer look at the images.


## Milestone 1, Part V: Additional Comments

[If you feel like you haven't fully explained your design choices, or if you want to explain some other functions in your site (such as special design decisions that might not meet the final project requirements), you can use this space to justify your design choices or ask other questions about the project and process.]




## Milestone 2, Part I: PHP Interactivity

[Describe here what you plan to do for your PHP Interactivity requirement.]

*  Appointment system:

	For users who have logged in, an interactive calendar, showing all available dates within two or three weeks, will be displayed. Users are able to select a specific date and make an appointment by clicking the button. For user who already has an appointment, he/she is able to cancel that existing appointment by clicking the delete button.
	For employees who are identified as administrators, the clients and their corresponding appointment dates can be shown so that the administrators can cancel or check in some client by deleting the corresponding appointments. Administrators can also make an appointment for their client. This part will be implemented in appointment.php.

*  Login:

	Users with existing accounts can login with their usernames and passwords. For logged in users, they can create an appointment or modify an existing appointment. For administrators, they can also modify or create appointments for their clients. Log in and log out function are needed for this part.

*  filter/search by project:

	Users can refine the search of past projects by selecting certain attributes such as locations and scales of the projects. This part will be implemented in portfolio.php.


## Milestone 2, Part II: Sketches, Navigation & Wireframes

### Sketches

![sketch](/images/project4-sketch1.jpg)


### Navigation

[What will be your top-level pages and your sub-pages for those top-level pages? What will your website's navigational structure?]

[Tip: If you use card sorting for your navigation, show us that work by including a picture!]

* Portfolio
  * past projects
* Services
  * Surveying
  * Engineering
* Our Team
* Log in
* Appointment

### Wireframes

## Milestone 2, Part III: Evaluate your Design

[Use the GenderMag method to evaluate your wireframes.]

[Pick a persona that you believe will help you address the gender bias within your design.]

I've selected **[Patricia]** as my persona.

Patricia is an ideal persona to select for this project. I've selected my persona because I feel as though she represents a part of the general public that I will be really targeting with my website. Patricia is willing to learn new technologies when necessary, but doesn't spend her free time doing this and still prefers technology that is comfortable to her. That is perfect for building a website for, as I can create a website with some interactivity that she would be willing to experiment with, but also make sure that I am still keeping my website simple enough that users would not have to put much thought into how to navigate the site, look at the company’s past products, find critical company information, and more. This way my website will be interactive and engaging to those who enjoy more complex technologies, but also still usable and simple enough for the rest of the public. Patricia also has medium computer self-efficacy when doing unfamiliar computing tasks, so she will keep trying if the some aspects of the site are hard to navigate through at first, which is beneficial. In terms of helping to address gender-inclusiveness bugs in the design, Patricia is also a perfect fit for this. Often, websites are designed more with males in mind, and do not take into account various patterns in self-efficacy present in females, or look at how females like (or do not like) tinkering with websites. Also, it is important to look at the different types of motivations that females have, as this is often focused more on with male subjects in website design. As discussed in class, females often have a goal when navigating a site, figure that out, and then move on to the next goal. There is a much clearer pattern to how they look at websites and figure out what to do, whereas males often play around and tinker far more, with less set patterns of goals. Since females are underrepresented often in design, we will use Patricia as a persona, but also keep in mind the way males often use websites as a whole.


### Tasks

[You will need to evaluate at least 3 tasks (known as scenarios in the GenderMag literature). List your tasks here. These tasks are the same as the task you learned in INFO/CS 1300.]

[For each task, list the ideal set of actions that you would like your users to take when working towards the task.]

Task 1: Patricia is a private sector investor, and very interested in learning more about Pietrzak & Pfau’s recent projects before committing to signing and working with them. She would like to see pictures of their past projects, and read more about at least three different individual projects that they have completed in the past.

1. Subgoal 1: Navigate to website
  * Action 1: Type in website URL
2. Subgoal 2: Find past projects to look at
  * Action 2: Locate homepage where projects are displayed with images
3. Subgoal 3: Look at information for each of the company’s past projects
  * Action 3: Click on the images on the homepage to be redirected to the individual info for each of the projects


Task 2: Patricia is now confident after seeing the past projects completed by the firm that she indeed wants to work with them. She would like to make an appointment, and see their availability to do so.

### Cognitive Walkthrough

[Perform a cognitive walkthrough using the GenderMag method for all of your Tasks. Use the GenderMag template in the <documents/gendermag-template.md> file.]

#### Task 1 - Cognitive Walkthrough

[copy the GenderMag template here and conduct a cognitive walkthrough to evaluate your design (wireframes).]

[You may need to add additional subgoals and/or actions for each task.]

Patricia is a private sector investor, and very interested in learning more about Pietrzak & Pfau’s recent projects before committing to signing and working with them. She would like to see pictures of their past projects, and read more about at least three different individual projects that they have completed in the past.

**Task name: Browsing past projects**

**Subgoal # 1 : Navigate to website**

- Will Patricia have formed this subgoal as a step to her overall goal?

Yes, Patricia will have. Her overall motivation is to do something with this company’s website, so she will know that in order to meet this overarching goal she needs to get to their website.

**Action # 1 : Type in website URL**

- Will Patricia know what to do at this step?

Yes. Patricia has some experience with technology and will know that in order to get to a website she must navigate to the URL.

- If she does the right thing, will she know she did the right thing, and is making progress to her goal?

Yes. Patricia reflects on all feedback she gets at each step along the way, as that is how she likes learning with tinkering. She will see she has gotten to the right website with the logo and company name that appears, and is on the right track.

**Subgoal # 2: Find past projects to look at**

- Will Patricia have formed this subgoal as a step to her overall goal?

Yes, Patricia will have. In terms of her motivation style, she doesn’t like clicking around randomly with technology, and likes to use methods she already knows and is comfortable with. To find past projects to look at, all she has to do is click around until she sees past projects on the site, and this is a method she is comfortable with (it is simple enough for her).

**Action # 2: Locate homepage where projects are displayed with images**

- Will Patricia know what to do at this step?

Yes. Patricia will see immediately when she navigates to the website that the past projects are displayed on the homepage. She doesn't even have to click around to find them. She reflects on feedback at each step, as that is her tinkering style, and will see right away in her reflection that she has found the past projects section.
- If she does the right thing, will she know she did the right thing, and is making progress to her goal?

Yes. Patricia has medium self-efficacy, and since the project images will be displayed directly in front of her, she will not doubt that she has found the correct section.

**Subgoal # 3: Look at information for each of the company’s past projects**

- Will Patricia have formed this subgoal as a step to her overall goal?

Yes, Patricia will have. Her clear motivation is to learn more about past projects, and she knows that in order to do this, she must find where on the website she can look at this information and learn more about these past projects. She sets clear goals, and tries to accomplish them, as part of her motivation strategy.

**Action # 3: Click on the images on the homepage to be redirected to the individual info for each of the projects**

- Will Patricia know what to do at this step?

Maybe. Patricia does not like tinkering without clear feedback, but if she hovers her mouse over one of the images of past projects, she will see that it lightens and that she can click on it. This is something she will remember from past experiences with websites, as her motivation style is to use methods she already knows.
- If she does the right thing, will she know she did the right thing, and is making progress to her goal?

Yes. Patricia has medium self-efficacy, and since the project images, once clicked on, will then direct her to details about the past projects, she will know she is at the right place. She will be receiving clear feedback and getting the information she wants.

#### Task 2 - Cognitive Walkthrough

Patricia is now confident after seeing the past projects completed by the firm that she indeed wants to work with them. She would like to make an appointment, and see their availability to do so.

**Task name: Make an appointment with the company**

**Subgoal # 1: Login**

- Will Patricia have formed this subgoal as a step to her overall goal?

Maybe. Patricia knows that her motivation is to set up an appointment, and with her motivations she likes to create a strategy of what she will do, rather than mindlessly tinkering around a website. She will possibly understand from experiences on past websites that in order to make appointments, the site will somehow have to know it is her. She will think about that she either will need to write her name when making the appointment, or login with a username.

**Action # 1: Locate login**

- Will Patricia know what to do at this step?

Yes. She tinkers around if she has a clear motivation in mind and will receive feedback on it. The login option is very clearly displayed on the navigation bar, so she will not have to do much tinkering around to find it, which is ideal for her.

- If she does the right thing, will she know she did the right thing, and is making progress to her goal?

Maybe. She will know that she got to the login page, as there will be clear feedback of that, but she will feel unclear if she is on the right track necessarily to making an appointment, as she will not have clear feedback if the login page is for individual users like her to make appointments. Her medium self-efficacy will cause her to feel a bit unsure.

**Action # 2: Create login and sign in with username and password**

- Will Patricia know what to do at this step?

Yes. She enjoys using technology that is familiar to her, and many sites have the option to create usernames and passwords and login, so this will all be familiar to her, and her pre-existing knowledge and skills will guide her.

- If she does the right thing, will she know she did the right thing, and is making progress to her goal?

Yes. She enjoys tinkering around when there is direct feedback, and she will see that when she creates the username and password she can then login and receive feedback that she has successfully logged in.

**Subgoal # 2: See available appointment times**

- Will Patricia have formed this subgoal as a step to her overall goal?

Yes. Patricia knows that in order to create an appointment, she needs to see what time slots are available. She likes to form a complete understanding of the problem before trying to solve it, as this is her information processing style. She has formed the idea in her head that in order to create an appointment, she needs to see times.

**Action # 3: Find interactive calendar with appointment time slots**

- Will Patricia know what to do at this step?

Yes. She will not have to tinker around much, as the calendar will appear with her log-in, and then she will see that each date on the calendar lists the available slots.

- If she does the right thing, will she know she did the right thing, and is making progress to her goal?

Yes. She will receive feedback immediately that the calendar and available dates are being displayed in front of her, and she will be confident in knowing that she is at the right place with the information displayed in front of her.

**Subgoal # 3: Schedule an appointment**

- Will Patricia have formed this subgoal as a step to her overall goal?

Yes. Again, Patricia likes to create a clear goal and think it through before acting on anything as her information processing style. She will know that scheduling an appointment is a clear necessity in having an appointment time set up with the company.

**Action # 4: Select a specific date on the calendar**

- Will Patricia know what to do at this step?

Yes. She will see that each date on the calendar lists available times, and that based on her past experiences on computers, that the line underneath each available time is a link that she can click on. Her past knowledge/skills will guide her.

- If she does the right thing, will she know she did the right thing, and is making progress to her goal?

Yes. She will be directed to the list of available times on that date, and this will be clear enough feedback for her to know that she did the right step, and her medium self-efficacy will make her sure of this.

**Action # 5: Click on make an appointment at the desired time**

-	Will Patricia know what to do at this step?

Yes. Since each time is a link, she will know that she can click on them from her past knowledge/skills.

- If she does the right thing, will she know she did the right thing, and is making progress to her goal?

Yes. She will see that there is a clear button for “Make appointment,” and her medium self-efficacy and past knowledge will assure her that this will schedule the appointment.


#### Task 3 - Cognitive Walkthrough

Patricia has now made an appointment, but realizes that she can no longer be free at on that day or at that time. She is worried the company will be very upset if she just does not show up. She needs to cancel her existing appointment, and make a new one at a time that now works for her.

**Task name: Modify an existing appointment**

**Subgoal # 1: Login**

- Will Patricia have formed this subgoal as a step to her overall goal?

Yes. Since Patricia has already gone through the subgoal before of finding the login, she will build on what she learned from that and complete the task in the same way with her now existing knowledge and skills.

**Action # 1: Find login tab**

-	Will Patricia know what to do at this step?

Yes. She tinkers around if she has a clear motivation in mind and will receive feedback on it. The login option is very clearly displayed on the navigation bar, so she will not have to do much tinkering around to find it, which is ideal for her. She has also already done this before, so it will be easier this time.

- If she does the right thing, will she know she did the right thing, and is making progress to her goal?

Yes. Since she has found the login before, she will know what to look for, and will feel more confident this time, as she likes working with technology she has used before.

**Action # 2: Sign into login with username and password**

-	Will Patricia know what to do at this step?

Yes. She enjoys using technology that is familiar to her, and many sites have the option to create usernames and passwords and login, so this will all be familiar to her, and her pre-existing knowledge and skills will guide her. Again, she has already done this in the task to create an appointment in the first place, so she will feel more confident in her actions.

- If she does the right thing, will she know she did the right thing, and is making progress to her goal?

Yes. She enjoys tinkering around when there is direct feedback, and she will see that when she signs in with her username and password she receives feedback that she has successfully logged in.

**Subgoal # 2: Get rid of existing appointment**

- Will Patricia have formed this subgoal as a step to her overall goal?

Yes.  Patricia likes to create a clear goal and think it through before acting on anything as her information processing style. She will know that canceling an existing appointment is a clear necessity in changing an appointment time.

**Action # 3: Find existing appointment on interactive calendar by the date**

-	Will Patricia know what to do at this step?

Yes. She will see that each date on the calendar lists available times. She will know that she found her current appointment time slot by navigating to the date, so she will repeat this action from her knowledge.

- If she does the right thing, will she know she did the right thing, and is making progress to her goal?

Yes. She will be directed to the list of available times on that date, and see her existing appointment listed, so she will know she has found the current appointment and information.

**Action # 4: Click delete button**

-	Will Patricia know what to do at this step?

Yes. She will see that the button is clearly something that can be clicked by the design to look like a typical button on a website, which makes it look like something she has seen before on many other sites.

- If she does the right thing, will she know she did the right thing, and is making progress to her goal?

Maybe. She will know that she has deleted the current appointment, as feedback will appear that the appointment is canceled, but since she has medium self-efficacy, she may be a bit unsure that this is how she goes about changing an appointment and not just canceling. She is not positive this is the most efficient method.

**Subgoal # 3: Make a new appointment**

- Will Patricia have formed this subgoal as a step to her overall goal?

Yes.  Patricia likes to create a clear goal and think it through before acting on anything as her information processing style. She will know that in order to have a new appointment and not just now be stuck with a canceled one, she must go through the process she went through before to create one.

**Action # 5: Pick a different date and time on the interactive calendar**

- Will Patricia know what to do at this step?

Yes. She has gone through this process before when creating her first appointment, and will build on her past knowledge and not have to tinker around much to achieve the subgoal and act this way.

- If she does the right thing, will she know she did the right thing, and is making progress to her goal?

Yes. She will receive the same feedback as before when creating an appointment, and know she is on the right track of the goal she has already accomplished once before.

**Action # 6: Click on make an appointment at that desired time**

-	Will Patricia know what to do at this step?

Yes. Since each time is a link, she will know that she can click on them from her past knowledge/skills.

- If she does the right thing, will she know she did the right thing, and is making progress to her goal?

Yes. She will see that there is a clear button for “Make appointment,” and her medium self-efficacy and past knowledge will assure her that this will schedule the appointment.



### Cognitive Walk-though Results

[Did you discover any issues with your design? What were they? How did you change your design to address the gender-inclusiveness bugs you discovered?]

[Your responses here should be very thorough and thoughtful.]

We did not discover too many issues with our design, and actually found that our current design plan is pretty effective in not having many gender-inclusiveness bugs. We provide very clear feedback each step of the way for a user going through the typical and expected tasks of the website, such as making it clear when a user is logged in, when they have scheduled an appointment, and when they have deleted an appointment. The navigation bar is also very easy to use, and having past projects on the front page makes them very easy to find and read more about, and draws a user right in to understanding more about both the company and the site. One area that we will work on is making it very clear what the login feature can be used for, as we plan to use it both for individuals scheduling appointments, and for administrators managing appointments. The one area during the cognitive walkthrough that received some “maybes” on if Patricia would know what to do, and would know she was on the right track, revolved around the login feature and making its purpose clear, so we plan to pursue this area in great depth, as it is the most important interactive feature of our website.


## Milestone 2, Part IV: Database Plan

### Database Schema

[Describe the structure of your database. You may use words or a picture. A bulleted list is probably the simplest way to do this.]

Tables:
Users, projects, images, tags, project_tags, clients, schedule

Table: users
* user_id: INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT UNIQUE
* username: TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
* password: TEXT NOT NULL,
* session: TEXT UNIQUE

Table: projects
* proj_id: INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT UNIQUE
* client_id: INTEGER NOT NULL
* project_name: TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
* project_address: TEXT NOT NULL,
* project_status: TEXT NOT NULL,
* project_description: TEXT NOT NULL

Table: images
* img_id: INTEGER AUTOINCREMENT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
* file_name: TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
* file_ext TEXT NOT NULL,
* proj_id: TEXT NOT NULL,
* PRIMARY KEY (img_id)
* FOREIGN KEY(proj_id) REFERENCES projects(proj_id)

Table: tags
* tag_id: INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT UNIQUE
* tag: TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,


Table project_tags (junction table)
* id: INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT UNIQUE
* tag: TEXT NOT NULL,
* proj_id: INTEGER NOT NULL,
* FOREIGN KEY(proj_id) REFERENCES projects(proj_id)

* client_id: TEXT NOT NULL,
* proj_id: INTEGER NOT NULL,
* datetime: INTEGER NOT NULL UNIQUE
* FOREIGN KEY(proj_id) REFERENCES projects(proj_id)
* FOREIGN KEY(client_id) REFERENCES clients(client_id)

### Database Queries

[Plan your database queries. You may use natural language, pseudocode, or SQL.]

* Get all project records:
```SQL
SELECT * FROM projects;
```
* Get all image records:
```SQL
SELECT * FROM images;
```
* Get all tag records:
```SQL
SELECT * FROM tags;
```
* add a tag Z:
```SQL
INSERT INTO tags VALUES (Z);
```
* add an image:
```SQL
INSERT INTO images (path, username)
VALUES (the_path, the_username);
```

* add a tag to an project:
```SQL
INSERT INTO project_tags
VALUES (the_tag, proj_id);
```
* delete an image X:
```SQL
DELETE FROM images
WHERE img_id = X;
```

* remove a tag Y from an project X:
```SQL
DELETE FROM project_tags
WHERE proj_id = X & tag = Y;
```

* get a path for a particular image with img_id X:
```SQL
SELECT path FROM images
WHERE img_id = X;
```

* Get all project records with tag X:
```SQL
SELECT *
FROM project_tags
INNER JOIN projects ON projects.img_id = project_tags.proj_id
WHERE proj_tag.tag = X;
```

* Get all tags for a project with proj_id = Y:
```SQL
SELECT tags.tag
FROM project_tags
INNER JOIN tags ON tags.tag =project_tags.tag
WHERE project_tags.proj_id = Y;
```

* add a meeting:
```SQL
INSERT INTO schedule (client_id, proj_id, datetime)
VALUES (client_id, proj_id, datetime);
```
* remove a meeting:
```SQL
DELETE FROM schedule
WHERE datetime = meeting_datetime;
```

* add a client:
```SQL
INSERT INTO clients (client_name)
VALUES (the_client_name);
```

* remove a client:
```SQL
DELETE FROM client
WHERE client_name = X;
```

* get client id:
```SQL
SELECT client_id
FROM clients
WHERE client_name = X;
```



## Milestone 2, Part V: Structure and Pseudocode

### Structure

[List the PHP files you will have. You will probably want to do this with a bulleted list.]

* index.php - main page that provides an overview of the company, including the logo, the services, the projects, and the employees.
* includes/init.php - global variables and functions that are useful for every web page.
* surveying.php - descriptions of all surveying services available.
* engineering.php -descriptions of all engineering services available.
* login.php - a page for users to log in.
* portfolio.php - a page that displays all projects the firm has finished.
* appointment.php - a page for logged in user to make an appointment with the firm.
* people.php - a page to list all employees in the firm.


### Pseudocode

[For each PHP file, plan out your pseudocode. You probably want a subheading for each file.]

#### index.php

```
include init.php
display the thumbnail images of a list of projects sorted by the date
display the services available, with clickable buttons directing to their corresponding pages
display some brief introduction of the team.

$projects = query the database for all portfolio information
display_portfolios($projects);

// if GET request is set to find a user-specified project by clicking the button for a project
$index = filter input for the project index
$project = query the database for that project
display the all the information pertaining to that specific project in a different style from displaying a collection of projects.

// if GET request is set to find projects with a specified attribute from the search form
$attribute = filter input
$projects = query the database for projects with the user-specified search field

#### Task 1 - Cognitive Walkthrough

Patricia is a private sector investor, and very interested in learning more about Pietrzak & Pfau’s recent projects before committing to signing and working with them. She would like to see pictures of their past projects, and read more about at least three different individual projects that they have completed in the past.

**Task name: Browsing past projects**

**Subgoal # 1 : Navigate to website**

- Will Patricia have formed this subgoal as a step to her overall goal?

Yes. Patricia's overall motivation is to work with and utilize Peitrzak & Pfau's website, so she will know that to meet this overrching goal she will have to get to their website.

**Action # 1 : Type in website URL**

- Will Patricia know what to do at this step?

Yes. Patricia has enough background experience with technology that she will know that in order to get to wa website she needs to use the URL.

- If she does the right thing, will she know she did the right thing, and is making progress to her goal?

Yes. Patricia likes to tinker when receiving feedback at each point. She will see she has gotten to the right website with the company name that appears at the top in the header, and is on the right track.

**Subgoal # 2: Find past projects to look at**

- Will Patricia have formed this subgoal as a step to her overall goal?

Yes, Patricia will have. This is a simple enough task for her in terms of tinkering. In terms of her motivation style, she doesn’t like clicking around randomly with technology, and likes to use methods she already knows and is comfortable with. To find past projects to look at, all she has to do is scroll and look around until she sees past projects on the site, and this is a method she is comfortable with (it is simple enough for her).

**Action # 2: Locate homepage where projects are displayed with images**

- Will Patricia know what to do at this step?

Yes. Patricia will see immediately when she navigates to the website that after slightly scrolling that the past projects are displayed on the homepage. It requires no clicking for her to find them. She reflects on feedback at each step, as that is her tinkering style, and will see right away in her reflection that she has found the past projects section.

- If she does the right thing, will she know she did the right thing, and is making progress to her goal?

Yes. Patricia has medium self-efficacy, and since the project images will be displayed directly in front of her, she will not doubt that she has found the correct section.

**Subgoal # 3: Look at information for each of the company’s past projects**

- Will Patricia have formed this subgoal as a step to her overall goal?

Yes, Patricia will have. Her clear motivation is to learn more about past projects, and she knows that in order to do this, she must find where on the website she can look at this information and learn more about these past projects. She sets clear goals, and tries to accomplish them, as part of her motivation strategy.

**Action # 3: Click on the images on the homepage to be redirected to the individual info for each of the projects**

- Will Patricia know what to do at this step?

Maybe. Patricia does not like tinkering without clear feedback, but if she hovers her mouse over one of the images of past projects, she will see that it becomes the generic hand symbol and that she can click on it. Her past experience with technology will allow her to know that this means that the image can be clicked. This is something she will remember from past experiences with websites, as her motivation style is to use methods she already knows.

- If she does the right thing, will she know she did the right thing, and is making progress to her goal?

Yes. Patricia has medium self-efficacy, and since the project images, once clicked on, will then direct her to details about the past projects, she will know she is at the right place. She will be receiving clear feedback and getting the information she wants.

#### Task 2 - Cognitive Walkthrough

Patricia is now confident after seeing the past projects completed by the firm that she indeed wants to work with them. She would like to make an appointment for her company, and see their availability to do so.

**Task name: Make an appointment with the company**

**Subgoal # 1: Locate Appointment Page**

- Will Patricia have formed this subgoal as a step to her overall goal?

Yes. Patricia knows that her motivation is to set up an appointment, and with her motivations she likes to create a strategy of what she will do, rather than mindlessly tinkering around a website. She will possibly understand from experiences on past websites that in order to make appointments, she will have to navigate to the part of the site where appointments are located.

**Action # 1: Locate Appointments**

- Will Patricia know what to do at this step?

Yes. She tinkers around if she has a clear motivation in mind and will receive feedback on it. The appointment option is very clearly displayed on the navigation bar, so she will not have to do much tinkering around to find it, which is ideal for her.

- If she does the right thing, will she know she did the right thing, and is making progress to her goal?

Yes. She will know that she got to the appointment page, as there will be clear feedback of that, and she will see immediately that it says on the page to schedule appointments at this section of the website.

**Subgoal # 2: Enter company info to schedule appointment**

- Will Patricia have formed this subgoal as a step to her overall goal?

Yes. Patricia knows that in order to create an appointment, she needs to enter what company she is from so that the appointment is associated with her in the system. She has past experiences with scheduling appointments online, and knows that the system needs to identify her in some way.

**Action # 2: Enter company name from dropdown**

- Will Patricia know what to do at this step?

Yes, there are clear instructions on the form, in addition to a dropdown menu that makes it very clear the three company options.

- If she does the right thing, will she know she did the right thing, and is making progress to her goal?

Yes. She will receive feedback immediately that her company was entered, and be able to move to the next section of the form, where specific information for her selected company's projects will be provided, so she will be able to see that she selected the right company.

**Action # 3: Enter current project from dropdown**

- Will Patricia know what to do at this step?

Yes, there are clear instructions on the form, in addition to a dropdown menu that makes it very clear the projects that are associated with her company.

- If she does the right thing, will she know she did the right thing, and is making progress to her goal?

Yes. She will receive feedback immediately that her company was entered, and be able to move to the next section of the form, where she will then be able to set a date and time for the appointment.

**Subgoal # 3: Create appointment**

- Will Patricia have formed this subgoal as a step to her overall goal?

Yes. Again, Patricia likes to create a clear goal and think it through before acting on anything as her information processing style. She will know that scheduling an appointment is a clear necessity in having an appointment time set up with the company.

**Action # 4: Enter a specific date**

- Will Patricia know what to do at this step?

Yes. Patricia knows that in order to create an appointment, she needs to enter a date in the date field. She likes to form a complete understanding of the problem before trying to solve it, as this is her information processing style. She has formed the idea in her head that in order to create an appointment, she needs to enter a date, and there is a clear field for that with instructions on the form.

- If she does the right thing, will she know she did the right thing, and is making progress to her goal?

Yes. She will see that there is a field for entering a date, with clear instructions, and that once she has entered a time that she can then click on the submit button, so there is clear feedback that it worked.

**Action # 5: Enter a specific time**

-	Will Patricia know what to do at this step?

Yes. Patricia knows that in order to create an appointment, she needs to enter a time slot. She likes to form a complete understanding of the problem before trying to solve it, as this is her information processing style. She has formed the idea in her head that in order to create an appointment, she needs to enter times based on what is told to be available to her.

- If she does the right thing, will she know she did the right thing, and is making progress to her goal?

Yes. She will see that there is a field for entering a time, with clear instructions, and that once she has entered a time that she can then click on the submit button, so there is clear feedback that it worked.

**Action # 6: Submit appointment**

-	Will Patricia know what to do at this step?

Yes. Since there is a clear "schedule" button, she will know that she should press that once done filling out the form.

- If she does the right thing, will she know she did the right thing, and is making progress to her goal?

Yes. She will see that the appointment is scheduled based on the text feedback displayed to her.


#### Task 3 - Cognitive Walkthrough

Patricia has now made an appointment and is eager to work with Pietrzak and Pfau, but now is curious to learn more about people who work with the firm and who she will be working with at her appointment. She also wants to take note of the addresses where Pietrzak & Pfau have offices in her planner to make sure she knows where to go.

**Task name: Learn more about the team at Pietrzak & Pfau**

**Subgoal # 1: Locate team page**

- Will Patricia have formed this subgoal as a step to her overall goal?

Yes. Patricia will know that in order to read about the people who work at Pietrzak & Pfau that she will need to locate where their info is on the website.

**Action # 1: Find team page on navigation bar**

-	Will Patricia know what to do at this step?

Yes. She tinkers around if she has a clear motivation in mind and will receive feedback on it. The "Our Team" option is very clearly displayed on the navigation bar, so she will not have to do much tinkering around to find it, which is ideal for her.

- If she does the right thing, will she know she did the right thing, and is making progress to her goal?

Yes. Once she clicks on the "Our Team" page she will be sent to a page with clear information about all of the members of the team, so the feedback in combination with her medium self-efficacy will make it clear to her that she is making progress to her goal.


**Subgoal # 2: Read about team members**

- Will Patricia have formed this subgoal as a step to her overall goal?

Yes.  Patricia likes to create a clear goal and think it through before acting on anything as her information processing style. She will know that reading about the members and seeing the content of the page is necessary to learn about the employees.

**Action # 2: Scroll through page and see info about team members**

-	Will Patricia know what to do at this step?

Yes. She will see that as she scrolls more and more team members' info appears on the page.

- If she does the right thing, will she know she did the right thing, and is making progress to her goal?

Yes. She will receive all the information about the team members that she was looking for. There will be clear feedback and she will know that she has reached her goal.

**Subgoal # 3: Find office locations**

- Will Patricia have formed this subgoal as a step to her overall goal?

Yes.  Patricia will know that in order to have a clear sense of where the company is located for her meeting, she will need to find the office locations as this is a clear step to her overall goal.

**Action # 3: Navigate to homepage**

- Will Patricia know what to do at this step?

Yes. She will see that none of the other tabs in the navigation bar say anything about contact or location, so the homepage will appear to be her best option for this information. She will also know from past experience with websites that often locations are displayed at the top or bottom of homepages.

- If she does the right thing, will she know she did the right thing, and is making progress to her goal?

Yes. She will receive feedback immediately from going to the homepage, as the overall towns of the office locations are displayed at the top of the screen.

**Action # 4: Find locations on bottom of homepage**

-	Will Patricia know what to do at this step?

Yes. Since she will have found the general town locations of the offices, but based on her past experience with technology will have a sense that the exact address will be at the footer/bottom of the homepage.

- If she does the right thing, will she know she did the right thing, and is making progress to her goal?

Yes. She will clearly see the locations section of the homepage in big letters, with the two addresses displayed beneath. This is clear feedback.

### Cognitive Walk-though Results

[Did you discover any issues with your design? What were they? How did you change your design to address the gender-inclusiveness bugs you discovered?]

[Your responses here should be very thorough and thoughtful.]

We did not discover any issues with our design. We kept gender-inclusiveness very much in mind through the entire design process, so we were not surprised when doing the final cognitive walk-through that our site actually had a very comprehensive design that was intuitive for all genders. We tested small cognitive walk-throughs throughout the building process and corrected small things as we went, so for our final cognitive walk-through our design was gender-inclusive and very easy to locate things.

## Milestone 5: Final Notes to the Clients

[Describe in some detail what the client will do (or would have to do) in order to make this website go live. What is the deployment plan?]

[Include any other information that your client needs to know about your final website design. For example, what client wants or needs were unable to be realized in your final product? Why were you unable to meet those wants/needs?]

## Milestone 5: Final Notes to the Graders

[1. Give us three specific strengths of your site that sets it apart from the previous website of the client (if applicable) and/or from other websites. Think of this as your chance to argue for the things you did really well.]

[2. Tell us about things that don't work, what you wanted to implement, or what you would do if you keep working with the client in the future. Give justifications.]

[3. Tell us anything else you need us to know for when we're looking at the project.]
