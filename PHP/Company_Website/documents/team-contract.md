# Team Contract

Working together as a team is critical for your success on this project. Conflicts happen. It's best to develop a plan before conflict arises. This way your team knows exactly the ground rules for dealing with that conflict. You'll be developing a team contract that you'll follow throughout the duration of your project. The team contract is a *living* document. If it's not working, your team should revise it as often as necessary.

You will need to learn to work in groups and resolve conflicts on your own. These skills will be expected of you by your employer after graduation. Use this project as an opportunity to develop these skills. Lastly, you might want to take note of the issues you encounter and how you solved them. I'm almost certain that you will be asked during an interview about a time you had and conflict and what you did to resolve it.

## Contract

**Your group contract/working agreement should include these elements. Feel free to add other terms, too.**

1. Team name or project name. Plus full name and NetID of each of your team members.

Blue-tiger

Team members:
Cari Himel (cjh326)
Yuzhe Sheng (ys766)
Min Zheng (mz474)
Shoshana Swell (ses372)
Baxter Demers (bld54)

2. To what goals do we all commit?

We hope to create a website that is interactive and client-based. We want to all contribute
equal amounts to the final product, and really feel that the website satisfies the need of our client.
We want to work as a cohesive team.

3. What are our âground rulesâ? (Don't make an exhaustive listâstick with just a few.)

We all will contribute equal amounts to the final product. We will maintain good communication and
respond to all messages. We will all complete our assigned parts of the product by the deadline.
We will meet all deadlines as a group, as well.

4. By what means and how frequently will we meet or communicate?

We will have a GroupMe that we communicate in, and we will meet in person at least once a week for each milestone.

5. How will we communicate and work with our client?

We will email our client and meet in person if necessary.

6. What roles will we create? Include a description of exactly what each role is responsible for.

The roles we will have are front-end developers and back-end developers. More exact roles will continue
to develop as we progress. The front-end developers will be responsible for working with the layout and CSS design
of the site, and the back-end developers will work more with creating databases and working with SQL. We will
all try to do a bit of both, however.

7. How will we hold ourselves and one another accountable? What (exactly) will we say to a team member who appears not to be contributing equally? To a team member who fails to deliver what was promised?

We will set clear deadlines for each aspect of the project and follow up with each other if we appear to not be making enough
progress to meet that individual deadline. We will all be genuinely interested in our project and want to meet deadlines, hopefully.
If someone is not contributing we will have a sit-down conversation with them, and further discuss what they need to do to contribute
more and what is holding them back.

8. What do we do when we disagree? What approach to conflict to we all agree to uphold?

We will meet in person and discuss the topic of conflict, and if necessary go with what majority feels is the right thing to do.

9. What are our procedures for re-visiting this contract?

If conflict arises and we are not meeting deadlines, we will re-visit this contract and reread our thoughts about how to
create a successful project.

10. What else do we want to include in this contract? (Think about a *fun* clause... not everything is always about work! Sometimes you need to celebrate your accomplishments!)

We want to have fun!

## Using your Contract

You are expected to follow your team contract. If you are having issues (e.g. conflicts) in your team, the first thing you should do is follow the contract. If the contract isn't working, then your team should revise it.

If you cannot resolve your issue using the contract, you may reach out to the instructor via the <info2300-prof@cornell.edu> email. Be advised, that the first thing the instructor will ask you is, "did you try to resolve your issue with the contract?" The next question the instructor will ask you is, "what change did you make to your contract to resolve the issue?"
